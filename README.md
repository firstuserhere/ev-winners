# Emergent Ventures Winners üåç

[Emergent Ventures Winners](https://evwinners.org) is a website collecting all the grantees of [Emergent Ventures](https://www.mercatus.org/emergent-ventures), initiated by economist and author [Tyler Cowen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Cowen) at the Mercatus Center of George Mason University; it's a fellowship and grant program designed to support ambitious ideas and moonshots aimed at improving society. I collected all the winners and the links to their announcements posts in one place, and this is the repo for it.

The site uses semantic similarity (based on embeddings) to power the search function, enabling you to search for people working on broad project areas (e.g. all winners who are doing a startup; machine learning; education; and so on.). The benefit of this is that you don't need to get the exact keywords in order to return relevant results.

## How it works

The semantic search function is powered by transformers.js and sentence-transformers, using the model all-MiniLM-L6-v2. The front-end is in Next.js 14 and deployed on Vercel.
