# Semantic Search for Emergent Ventures Winners üåç

[Emergent Ventures](https://www.mercatus.org/emergent-ventures), initiated by economist and author [Tyler Cowen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Cowen) at the Mercatus Center of George Mason University, is a fellowship and grant program designed to support ambitious ideas and moonshots aimed at improving society. 

I collected all the winners and the links to their announcements posts in one place, and this is the repo for it; you can visit the website at [https://evwinners.org](https://evwinners.org). The site uses semantic similarity (based on embeddings) to power the search function, enabling you to search for people working on broad project areas (e.g. all winners who are doing a startup; machine learning; education; and so on.). The benefit of this is that you don't need to get the exact keywords in order to return relevant results.

## How it works

The semantic search function is powered by transformers.js and sentence-transformers, using the model all-MiniLM-L6-v2. The front-end is in Next.js 14 and deployed on Vercel.
